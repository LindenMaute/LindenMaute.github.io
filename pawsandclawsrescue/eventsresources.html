        <h2 class="education-header">Simple Education Goes a Long Way</h2>

        <h3 class="education-subhead">Trap, Neuter, and Release (TNR)</h3>

        <img src="images/cat15.jpg" alt="Cat hiding behind box" class="education-image">

        <p>Trap, Neuter, Release is one of the most compassionate and effective ways we can support outdoor and community cats. A lot of these cats aren't socialized to people and would be miserable if we tried to force them into indoor life. TNR allows them to stay in the environment they know while still receiving the medical care and protection they need. Volunteers humanely trap the cats, bring them in for spay or neuter surgery, vaccines, and a checkup, and then once they have recovered, they are returned to their home territory. This simple cycle changes a cat colony's entire future.</p>
        <p>One of the most important impacts of TNR is stopping the nonstop cycle of kittens being born outside. Many people don't realize just how quickly one unaltered female cat can lead to dozens of kittens within a single year. Most of those kittens struggle to survive, and many end up in shelters that are already overwhelmed. By spaying or neutering just one cat, we prevent a chain reaction of suffering. Fewer kittens being born means each remaining cat gets more stability, more resources, and a calmer environment.</p>
        <p>Neutered cats also behave differently. Once a colony is fixed, the level of fighting, roaming, and spraying drops dramtically. The cat become quieter, more relaxed, and far less likely to attract attention from neighbors who may not understand them. Vaccinating the cats keeps them healthier and protects pets and people in the area. Over time, a TNR managed colony becomes more stable, healthy, and predictable, which helps both the cats and the community feel safer.</p>
        <p>TNR doesn't just help cats - it helps people who care about them. When a neighborhood has a managed colony, residents notice less nuisance behavior, fewer litters appearing, and a more peaceful coexistence between the cats and the community. It also supports local shelters by reducing intake numbers, which allows rescues to focus resources on sick, injured, and adoptable animals. TNR is the long-term, humane approach that makes a real difference, one cat at a time.</p>

        <h3 class="education-subhead">FeLV+</h3>
        <p>FeLV+ means a cat has tested positive for Feline Leukemia Virus, and while that diagnosis sounds intimidating, it absolutely does not mean a cat can't live a loving and meaningful life. Many FeLV+ cats show very few symptoms for long periods of time. What they really need most is a calm home, consistent vet care, good nutrition, and someone who is willing to love them just as they are. These cats often bond very deeply with the people who care for them, because they know what it feels like to finally be safe.</p>
        <p>FeLV affects the immune system, but every cat experiences it differently. Some cats stay healthy for years, especially when they are kept indoors away from stress and other illnesses. They enjoy all the same things as any other cat - warm blankets, cozy corners, gentle playtime, and the comfort of being part of a family. Many adopters say their FeLV+ cats are some of the sweetest, most affectionate companions they've ever had.</p>
        <p>One important thing to know is that FeLV+ cats do best as the only cat or in homes with other FeLV+ cats. This helps protect everyone and keeps the environment consistent and safe. As long as these cats get routine vet checks, a clean indoor home, and a stress-free lifestyle, they can live comfortably and enjoy life just as much as any other kitty. Their condition does not define who they are or how much happiness they can bring.</p>
        <p>Sadly, many FeLV+ cats get overlooked in shelters simply because of the label, even when they are young, friendly, and full of personailty. They often wait far longer for a home - or never get a chance at all. Choosing to foster or adopt a FeLV+ cat is incredibly meaningful. You're giving a cat who would otherwise be passed over the chance to feel safe, loved, and valued. These animals often appreciate every bit of kindness, and they have a way of creating deep, unforgettable connections with the people who take a chance on them.</p>
        <p>When you open your heart to a FeLV+ cat, you aren't just giving them a home - you're becoming part of their story, helping them live a life filled with comfort and joy. There's something incredibly special about caring for a cat who has been overlooked, and the love they give back is worth every moment.</p>

    <h2 class="education-header">Surrendering a Pet</h2>
    <p>Sometimes life changes in ways we never expected. Moving, health issues, money struggles, or changes in the home can make it feel impossible to keep a pet, and that can be heartbreaking. If you're thinking about surrendering your dog or cat, please know you're not alone and you're not a bad person for asking for help. Our goal is to make sure every animal is safe and cared for, whether they stay with you or come into the rescue.</p>

    <img src="images/dog16.jpg" alt="Pretty dog" class="edu-image">

    <p>Surrendering a pet means legally transferring them to a shelter or rescue so we can provide care, vetting, and work on finding a new home. Whenever possible, we ask that owners reach out to us before dropping an animal off somewhere else or rehoming them online. Sharing honest information about medical needs, behavior, and daily routines helps us place them with a family that's a good fit and keeps everyone safer.</p>

    <h4>Before You Decide to Surrender</h4>
    <p>In some cases, a little support can help keep a pet in their home. If you're struggling, you can ask about:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pet food or supply assistance</strong> when money is tight.</li>
        <li><strong>Basic training and behavior tips</strong> for common issues like jumping, housetraining, or scratching.</li>
        <li><strong>Community resources</strong> such as low cost vet care, spay/neuter, or temporary help.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If surrender is still the best and safest choice, we will walk you through our process, which may include an appointment, an intake form, and an evaluation. This helps your pet transition with less stress and gives us the information we need to care for them properly.</p>
    <p>Asking for help is an act of kindness. Whether we're helping you keep your pet or helping them find a new family, we're here to support both you and your animal as best we can.</p>
