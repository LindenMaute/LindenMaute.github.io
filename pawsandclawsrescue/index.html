            <h2>About Paws & Claws Rescue</h2>

            <img src="images/dog4.jpg" alt="Rescue dog">

            <p>
                Paws & Claws Rescue is a volunteer-driven, no-kill organization focuesed on giving abandoned, neglected, and at-risk animals a genuine second chance. Our team works every day to provide a safe, nurturing environment where each dog and cat can recover, build confidence, and eventually find the loving home they've always deserved. We believe that every animal has a story worth hearing and a life worth protecting.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond daily care, our rescue is committed to making a real difference in the community. We run adoption events, partner with local shelters, and connect with families who are ready to open their homes to a pet in need. Through our foster program, animals receive individualized love and support while they wait for their fur-ever families. We also focus on public education, helping people understand the importance of adoption, responsible pet ownership, and the impact of choosing no-kill rescues.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether we're comforting scared strays, helping pets heal, or guiding new adopters, our mission remains the same: to create a future where every animal feels safe, valued, and loved. We strive to be a source of hope for animals who have been overlooked or mistreated, and a trusted resource for the families who welcome them home. Every day, we're reminded that even the smallest act of kindness can change an animal's entire world and that's what continues to inspire our work and strengthen our commitment to the pets who rely on us.
            </p>
            <p>Since opening our doors in 2014, we've proudly helped 6,234 pets find loving homes - including 3,742 dogs and 2,494 cats. Every animal that leaves our rescue is spayed or neutered, ensuring they start their new life healthier, safer, and part of a more responsible future for pet ownership.</p>

            <h2>No-Kill Commitment</h2>

            <img src="images/cat5.jpg" alt="Two kittens playing with a toy">
            <p>
                As a proud no-kill rescue, we make sure every animal who enters our care is given the time, patience, and compassion they need no matter their situation. We believe every pet deserves a real chance to feel safe and loved, and we never rush or give up on the animals who rely on us. Some pets need a little extra reassurance, while others simply need a stable place to rest and recover. No matter what they've been through, we meet each animal exactly where they are and help them move forward with confidence.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our approach focuses on healing, confidence-building, and finding the right match for each pet. Whether it's medical support, behavioral help, or simply providing comfort, we do everything we can to help every cat and dog move toward the safe, stable home they deserve. We work closely with fosters, adopters, trainers, and veterinarians to make sure every animal has what they need to thrive. It's all part of our commitment to ensuring each pet gets the chance to start over and become part of a loving family. It is our promise as a no-kill shelter, we will never give up on any animal that comes through our doors.
